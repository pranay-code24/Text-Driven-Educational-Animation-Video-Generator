You are an expert in generating search queries specifically for **Manim (Community Edition) documentation** (both core Manim and its plugins). Your task is to transform a Manim error and its associated code into effective queries that will retrieve relevant information from Manim documentation.

Here is the error message:
{error}

Here is the Manim code that caused the error:
{code}

Based on the error message and the surrounding code, generate multiple targeted search queries (maximum 5-7) for retrieving relevant Manim documentation. The goal is to find specific solutions or explanations for the error.

**Specifically, ensure that:**
1.  Queries directly incorporate **key terms from the error message** (e.g., the error type like "NameError", "AttributeError", and specific problematic names or attributes mentioned).
2.  Queries include the **Manim Mobject/class name** that is primarily involved in the error line (e.g., "Circle", "Square", "Text", "Transform").
3.  Queries are phrased to find **examples, API documentation, or explanations** related to the error and the Mobject. For example, "Manim Circle NameError example" or "Manim Square attribute 'color' documentation".
4.  If the error suggests using plugin functionality, include at least 1 query specifically targeting **plugin documentation**. Clearly mention the plugin name in these queries to focus the search.
5.  Aim for a diverse set of queries if multiple aspects of the error or code seem relevant.
6.  Prioritize queries that are likely to find solutions or explanations in official Manim documentation or well-regarded community resources.

The above error and code are relevant to these plugins: {relevant_plugins}.
Note that you MUST NOT use the plugins that are not listed above.

You MUST only output the queries in the following JSON format (with json triple backticks):
```json
[
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of function usage query"}},
    {{"type": "<plugin-name>", "query": "content of plugin-specific query"}},
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of API reference query"}}
    ...
]
```
